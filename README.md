# Moodboard-Website
a project to help learn the ropes of frontend and backend design.

## Project description
### Functional requirements
what the app will do.
The app's main function will be a moodboard. It will be downloadable on PC.

It is basically a blank board where you can paste links, images, gifs or videos or even recordings(optional) from the internet and add notes to annotate it.
 - I'm taking some inspiration from moodboard appls like Ar*ena, Behance and Cosmos.

The app will feature a login function so users can access their moodboards across different devices. An authorisation function will ensure that their data and privacy is well-protected from hackers and people with malicious intent. - Maybe I'll even add a human verification step.
--> the login function will use google accounts which will be the profile

My moodboard will have different themes and customisable options. It allows users to:
- move items around
- change the background colour
- change font colour, size and highlight text
- click on buttons to use different functions
- move across the whiteboard by scrolling and using the mouse to click and drag.

to allow users to easily use the app:
- can just copy and paste images(crop and spin is optional)

social network:
share moodboard with others, similar to google docs
great for group design projects!


### Non-functional requirements
what the app will looks like + how it will function

To enter the app, you need to create an account, verify it, then login.

The app will look like a plain whiteboard with a control bar at the top(similar to google docs). By interacting with this control bar, users should be able to have access to all the customisation functions.

if the website doesn't load, an error message will pop up with a list of all the reasons it did not work.

if the login is incorrect, a message will pop up.

if the image/element pasted into the app doesn't work, a message will say "image not valid??"

when the system is loading, a loading screen with a spinning circle will pop up.

the system shouldn't overload and is expected to have a good response time.


This entire coding process should not be too difficult because there are tutorials online and what i have decided to do follows closely to the conent we learnt in grok.
