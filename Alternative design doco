Alternative Design Doco

I've decided to do my digital design on Canva then annotate it on Canva whiteboard. The design should be in the respitory.
With my alternate design, I decided to go with a more fun and creative approach.
I used a bright and lively colour palette and a paper-texture web backdrop to evoke a messy, collagable and artistic effect. With this effect, I want users to feel 
relaxed and able to freely put together a moodboard without constraints for neatness. For the loading screen I wanted to create a more relaxing and 
harmonious atmosphere so I used warm gradients an a touching quote.

I've added new features such as the help button, AI partner, voice input, searchbar and commenting/editing/viewing functions to promote the flexibility and usability of my software.
To flesh out how my site functions as a social network, I've made annotations and went more in-depth on how collaboration across these boards will work(colour-coded pointers, real-time updates).
I've planned something similar to collabing on google docs or canva. 

For many functions and elements I've drawn inpiration from highly user-friendly colab softwares like Milanote, Google docs and Canva. The inspiration can be found in the
form of small cut-outs from these apps in my wireframe. These serve as a rough draft to how my site should function.
