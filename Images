## Vision Wireframe
The social network I'm designing will be called Vision.

Note: it is a Design Website, not app
The style I am going for is a simple and elegant. I'm planning on using font Vollkorn. 
This is the logo

My colour palette will be grey because grey is a flexible colour which will adapt to different moodboard themes. I've tried to keep the website simple because my capabilities, time and recources are limited, however I should be able to create a simple model of this design.

Next week I'm planning on refining my web design on Wix because so far it is very rough, and I need to see how it will look and flow on a laptop.
